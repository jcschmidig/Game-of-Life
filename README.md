# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implemntation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).<br>
I wrote an [article on medium](https://medium.com/@1553340074027/architecture-of-a-web-application-built-with-svelte-1ea9614228f4?sk=a540b3449b1f4d8207f736bcfed2ae44) to explain its architecture.

## Prerequisites
