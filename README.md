# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implemntation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).<br>
I wrote an [article on medium](https://medium.com/@1553340074027/architecture-of-a-web-application-built-with-svelte-1ea9614228f4) to explain its architecture.

## Prerequisites
[Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are used to compile the web application to pure html.

## Installation
Use https://github.com/jcschmidig/Game-of-Life.git to clone the app from GitHub
```
npm install
```

## Compile
```bash
npm run build
```

## Launch
```bash
cd public
open index.html
```
